# Personnel-Strength-Summarizer
This program I created provides a summary of the numbers of personnel present in my camp at any one point of time, upon inputting a parade state list. A parade state list is essentially a long line of text that containts information about personnel on leaves, course, etc.

This is useful for accounting for personnel present within the camp. I have converted this into a website for a better UX: tinyurl.com/paradestatecount

This is used by the higher ups in my camp to collate personnel strength in camp.
